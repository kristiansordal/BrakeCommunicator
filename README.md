This is a repository containing assignments for the course INF339A at UiB.

## Mat-Vec-Mult
This is a parallelized matrix-vector multiplier, it implements row-based, column-based and grid-based multiplication.


## Sparse-Matrix
This builds on the previous assignment, and implements sparse vector-matrix multiplication using the ELLpack format. It contains some visualizer, mostly used as a sanity check that my code is correct. But it also looks nice.
